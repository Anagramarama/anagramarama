Anagramarama 0.1
(c) 2003 Colm Gallagher - under the terms of the GPL - see gpl.txt for details.

Version 0.1 -   still needs a high score table and some
		informational messages, but you can play a game.

Need to do a major code clean up too and document some stuff...

I'll get round to it for the v1 release

in the meantime have fun and let me know if you find any problems
